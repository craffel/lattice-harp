The Lattice Harp is a hybrid stringed musical instrument and button grid; you can read more about it in [the paper](http://colinraffel.com/publications/icmc2010the.pdf).
This repository contains the source code for the Arduino which lives on board the Lattice Harp, as well as a few example Pd patches.
